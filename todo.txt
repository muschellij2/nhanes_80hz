# script must read in acc_csv (rename test)
# should we keep 1sec in there?  I think yes
# Then compare to counts_1s file - make sure all rows there (except maybe last)
# compare the values themselves
# call columns "steps"
# rename test_acc_csv to actilife_counts_1s
# create a actilife_steps_1s with the data (should it be steps and counts or just counts?)
# ask the group
